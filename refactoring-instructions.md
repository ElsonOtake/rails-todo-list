## Refactoring Guidelines

1. **Code Quality Improvements**
   - Identify and eliminate code duplication
   - Extract complex logic into well-named methods
   - Improve variable and method naming for clarity
   - Apply SOLID principles where applicable

2. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Optimize database queries (N+1 query prevention)
   - Add appropriate indexes
   - Implement caching where beneficial
   - Reduce memory allocation in hot paths

3. **Rails Best Practices**
   - Use Rails conventions and idioms
   - Leverage ActiveRecord scopes and callbacks appropriately
   - Implement proper error handling
   - Add data validations where missing

4. **Testing**
   - Ensure all changes maintain or improve test coverage
   - Add tests for any new functionality
   - Refactor test code for better maintainability

5. **Documentation**
   - Update code comments where necessary
   - Document complex business logic
   - Update CLAUDE.md if architecture changes

## Files to Focus On
Based on the issue description, prioritize refactoring in these areas:
- Models with complex business logic
- Controllers with multiple responsibilities
- Views with excessive logic
- JavaScript controllers that could be simplified

## Success Criteria
- All existing tests pass
- Code follows Rails conventions
- Improved readability and maintainability
- No performance regressions
